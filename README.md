## Inspiration

Needless to say, every achievement we've made thus far has been aided by technology. I feel it is our obligation to make life easier for individuals and make them independent. That's why we devised a remedy that could boost the spirits of persons suffering from long-term memory impairments. **Alzheimer's and other kinds of dementia** pose one of the most difficult problems for the human race. It is currently the sixth most prominent cause of death among all diseases and one of the primary causes of impairment and reliance among the elderly worldwide. Patients with this disease require a caretaker, generally a family member. This has a significant impact on both the caregiver and the caregiver, who is susceptible to **depression and has high-stress levels**. 

**"How can I help Alzheimer's patients? How can I make this whole world accessible to them? How can they remember, and recall the memories and happy moments that they have shared with their loved ones? How can they keep these moments with them safe?"**

To address these issues, I intended to make things simpler for both patients and caregivers. Presenting, _HOME_, House Of Memories.

## **What it does**

_HOME_ is a mobile-based application that provides stability and reliability on its own. The accessible and inclusive application, built with different user-friendly features for both caregivers and patients, helps to address the impairments that individuals with Alzheimer's confront on a daily basis. Instead of being a solution to a specific problem, the application provides several answers to related situations. It allows patients with Alzheimer's disease to keep a sense of identity despite the disease's progression, which offers a significant challenge to carers, professionals, and family caregivers. Patient's current location, emergency contacts, automatic dial-up in emergencies, daily quizzes, audio-visual notes, and several other features are incorporated into this application.

## How I built it

I used Flutter to create this application. Canva and Figma were used to create the theme of the application by considering Alzheimer's patient's response to a particular color.

## Challenges I ran into

To develop an efficient solution, accurate information on the challenges experienced by Alzheimer's patients was studied. Creating a full-fledged functional prototype at my first hackathon, solely was frantic yet exciting.

## Accomplishments

I'm proud that I didn't leave this journey in between, took all the difficulties as challenges, and created clean, intuitive, functional, and effective solutions for Alzheimer's patients.

## What I learned

I discovered new methods to organize and arrange my thoughts, as well as how to balance my time between certain tasks, prioritize them accordingly, and work more effectively!

## What's next for HOME

I aim to reinforce our project with more potential features.

1. _Gamify the UI_ to enhance _cognitive skills_ and provide _animated guides_ for the patients.
2. Adding a _notification system_ for the patients.
3. _Early detection system_ to diagnose the disease.
4. Create _self-help groups and communities_ to fight the battle against this disease.
